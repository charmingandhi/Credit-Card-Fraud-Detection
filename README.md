# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

---

## 📑 Overview

Credit card fraud is a significant threat 💥. In this project, we use **machine learning** to detect fraudulent transactions 🔍.  
The goal is to correctly classify transactions as **fraudulent** or **legitimate**.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values
- Dealing with imbalanced dataset using **SMOTE**
- Feature scaling with **StandardScaler**

## 🚀 Model Building

We experimented with different models:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

✅ The best model was selected based on **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
